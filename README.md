# [TourneyMod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-league-blaze/p/avg_duck/TourneyMod/)

Adds many tournament-related features for Tournament Organizers and players! Currently designed for LAN tournaments only (local 1v1 mode), with support for online tournaments planned for a future version.

_Note: This mod is NOT compatible with [Daioutzu's StageSelect](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-league-blaze/p/Daioutzu/StageSelect/)!_

## Features

### Dynamic Set Count

Manually keep track of game wins no longer! TourneyMod keeps track of what game in the set the players are on, who won each set and on what stage, and displays the current set score!

A new set can be started simply by backing out and creating a new lobby.

### Integrated Stage Striking

Have trouble remembering the legal stage list? Avoid stage striking because it takes too long outside the game? Never again! Stage striking is now fully integrated inside the stage select screen!

This system supports both counterpick stages and DSR bans!

In case of a ruleset error or a Gentleman's agreement, players can also vote to toggle Free Pick Mode, bypassing the ban system!

Free Pick Mode preserves the set history, so it can be toggled back on to restore all calculated and manual bans.

### Custom Rulesets

The legal stage list as well as striking rules are specified in their own ruleset files, and can quickly be swapped between in the mod config or with [MrGentle's ModMenu](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-league-blaze/p/MrGentle/ModMenu/). ModMenu will show a list of all loaded rulesets for easy reference!

The mod comes packaged with a set of default rulesets, but by creating a new file you can create any number of your own rulesets! A [guide to ruleset files](https://github.com/avgduck/TourneyMod/wiki/Custom-Rulesets) can be found on the wiki.

## Planned Features

TourneyMod is planned to be expanded to enhance the entire tournament experience. This includes:

* Offline crew battle mode
* Online striking and set tracking

and more! Be on the lookout for future updates, and feel free to submit any bug reports or feature requests to the [TourneyMod issues page](https://github.com/avgduck/TourneyMod/issues).
